## Introduction

Protea is a type-safe and multi-paradigm programming language designed to be used in building cross-platform client- and server-side applications, with a focus on performance and simplicity. It was born out of the overall frustration of the JavaScript ecosystem and language, while still embracing the "JS everywhere" paradigm.

Protra comes with a lightning-fast compiler that outputs a highly optimized and performant JavaScript code, while keeping a syntax that looks like it, while avoiding many of the mistakes from languages past. and the ecosystem within your reach. You can also use Protea to build your own custom components, give them styling and functionality and use them in your applications.

---

If you have any questions, comments or suggestions for the language, please feel free to open an issue on GitHub and I will promptly respond. Protea is currently still in its conceptual and experimental stage, as I am still experimenting on the language's grammar.

This document mainly serves as a guide to the its design and semantics, and will touch a bit on the implementation.

# Protea's Reference

This section serves as an informal guide to the Protea language. This is not a tutorial or introductory guide but rather something you can consult if you have questions about the language and its future implementation(s). We will introduce bits and pieces of the language's syntax and features as we go.

## Hello World!

```dart
// Backend
proc main(): void {
  print("Hello, world!")
}

// Frontend
elem App {
  <div>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  </div>
}
```

### Source code representation

Protea source code is encoded in UTF-8 which is the same default encoding as other languages. Protea modules use the extension `.pta`. The module name is the file name without the extension, and is implicitly wrapped in a `module` declaration. Modules can be imported to and exported from other modules.

An interface file contain the extension `.pti` and is used to declare interfaces and types of a module with the same name. The interface file is implicitly imported by the module, and can be mixed, through type declarations and type aliases, with the module's source code, in a similar fashion to TypeScript.

A script file contains the extension `.pti`. Including scripts would also run the script in the same scope as the script it is run from, similar to C header files.

## Lexical elements

### Comments

Comments are the same as in JavaScript, though they are inserted back into the output code if pretty-printing is enabled. Documentation comments are not ignored, but are gathered by the compiler to produce a documentation tree to allow devs to find docs, and with the help of extensions to do so even more easily.

Every line in documentation comments do not need to start with an asterisk. The compiler will automatically add an asterisk to every line that does not start with one. This is to make it easier to find the documentation for a given element.

```dart
// This is a single line comment.
/*
  This is a multiline comment.
  /* It can be nested. */
*/

/// This is a single line documentation comment.
/**
  This is a multiline documentation comment
  /* It can be nested. */
*/
```

### Semicolons and commas

In other languages, inserting semicolons to separate statements is required. In JavaScript, this is not necessary, but it is completely buggy.

Protea is a newline-sensitive language. This means that statements are usually not separated by semicolons. The compiler will automatically insert semicolons at the end of line if the next token can begin an expression: except a closing bracket, an infix operator, and the keywords `then`, `elif`, `else`, `catch` and `after`.

The rules for parsing commas are the same as semicolons, except they are used to separate expressions, not necessarily statements.

### Identifiers

Identifiers name program entities like variables and types. An identifier begins with a sequence of one or more letters `L`, digits `Nd`, marks `M`, underscores `Pc` and dashes `Pd`, with the following restrictions:

- begins with a letter or underscore
- does not end with one or more trailing dashes.

```dart
identifier = `\b[\pPc\pL][\d\pL\pM\pPc\pPd]*\b`
```

Non-lowercase letters are considered uppercase.

#### Identifier equality

Protea uses a rather unorthodox/complex approach to comparing identifiers, so to accommodate different naming conventions without having to worry about how identifiers are spelled.

The exception with respect to the first non-lowercase letters allows common code like `var foo: Foo == FOO` to be parsed unambiguously. `foobar`, `foo-bar`, `foo_bar` and `fooBar` are considered equal, but `FOOBAR`, `FooBar` and `foo_bar` are not.

```dart
"FOOBar" == "FOO_Bar" == "FOO-Bar"
"FOOBAR____" == "FOOBAR"
"fooBar" == "foobar" == "foo_bar" == "foo-bar"
"Ã©glise" == "eglise"
```

Several transforms are performed before identifiers are compared:

- Text is converted into its Unicode normalization form; this means that accents are removed, and ligatures are replaced with their base characters.
- Non-alphanumeric characters are removed, including accents, underscores and dashes
- The first non-lowercase letters are stripped out from the beginning of the identifier and left as-is
- The other part of the identifier is transformed into lowercase and converted as such

```dart
func cmpIdent(a: str, b: str): bool = normalize(a) == normalize(b)

func normalize(id: str): str {
  val ident = id.decompose(:nfkd).replace(`[^\pL\d]` ``)
  val { begin, end } = ident.match(`\b
    (?!\d) // ignore leading digits
      (?<begin>[\pPc\pL][\d\pL\pM\pPc\pPd--\pLl]*)?
      (?<end>[\d\pL\pM\pPc\pPd]*)
    \b // ignore trailing dashes
  `)
  return (begin + end.lower)
}
```

Two identifiers are considered equal if the following function returns true:

Note that this rule does not apply to keywords, which are all written in all-lowercase.

### Keywords

The following names are reserved words. These keywords are divided into five groups:

```dart
in of as is new to til thru by del unset ref and or xor not
var val func proc type class data enum module iter macro inter object trait style elem prop
do then def go defer with from where if elif else for each loop while try throw catch after match case fail
goto pass break next redo retry return yield await label use show hide route
debug assert check

true false null nan void infin it this that self super args ctor proto
```

Modifier keywords go before a declaration keyword.

```dart
pub priv prot final over immut mut
global local intern extern imply exply

seal abst impure pure early late covar
contra async sync stat dyn lazy eager
bound free uniq struct

rec oper curry inline prefix suffix infix
left right binary unary
```

Some of these modifiers are for future use.

Because of how identifiers are compared, you can use any number of trailing underscores to "strop" a keyword to turn it into an identifier. Keywords also become identifiers when part of a qualified name, such as `x.for.then` or `y::loop`, as well as within literals (with some exceptions).

```dart
var var_ = "Hello Stropping"
type obj = { type: int }
val object_ = new obj(type_: 9)
assert object_ is obj
assert object_.type == 9
var var_ = 42; val val_ = 8
assert var_ + val_ == 50
var assert_ = true
assert assert_
```

### Terminators

Protea is a line-oriented language where expressions may be terminated with semicolons and newlines, and commas inside bracketed literals. A newline in a source text is considered a token if these criteria are met:

- The last token in the line ends an expression;
- The first token in the next line begins an expression;
- The token appears in a region where newlines are enabled.

The tokens that can terminate an expression are:

- an identifier
- a literal
- a closing bracket
- a suffix operator
- a control transfer keyword (fourth group of keywords above)

Newlines are enabled in:

- all of a Trinity source file, except for regions where newlines are disabled, and
- between pairs of brackets

...and disabled in:

- control structures
- declarations
- imports
- control transfer statements

...except for nested regions where newlines are enabled.

For brevity purposes, a semicolon or comma can be omitted before a closing bracket, so `[1, 2, 3]` is the same as `[1, 2, 3,]` and so on.

## Literals

### Numbers

Numeric literals are either integers or floating point numbers, though they can be extended to include other types such as unsigned, rational, complex and imaginary numbers, and whether or not the number is arbitrary-precision.

#### Integers

An integer literal is a sequence of digits. An optional prefix sets a non-decimal base: `0b` for binary, `0o` for octal, `0x` for hexadecimal. In hexadecimal literals, letters `a` thru `f` (or `A` thru `F`) represent values 10 thru 15.

For readability, underscore characters `_` may appear between digits. Leading zeroes may also appear at the beginning of said literal or after the prefix of multi-base literals.

```dart
1 // int
1n // nat
1i // int
1ln // int

18446744073709551616 // bigint
18_446_744_073_709_551_616 // bigint

decimal = 11256099
hex = 0x0123456789ABCDEF
octal = 0o52740443
binary = 0b101010111100000100100011
```

#### Floating points

A decimal floating point literal consists of a mantissa and an exponent. The mantissa consists of an integer and a fractional part, and both must be present. The exponent is optional, and can have an optional sign. The exponent scales the mantissa (integer and fractional part) by powers of 10.

A binary, octal or hexadecimal floating literal is structured the same way as a decimal floating point literal except that the exponent scales the mantissa by powers of 2, and is prefixed with `0b`, `0o` or `0x` respectively.

```dart
1.0  // float
1.0f // float
1f   // float
1r   // rat

1j     // imag
1 + 1j // comp

decimal = 11256099.012e+14
hex = 0xABC1234.012p-40
octal = 0o52740443.012p-40
binary = 0b10101011110.0000100100011p-40
```

Several suffixes can be used in conjunction with one another, as shown above.

- `n` for unsigned
- `l` for arbitrary-precision (i.e long)
- `i` for imaginary numbers
- `r` for rational numbers
- `f` for floating point literals

### Strings

A string literal consists of a character sequence enclosed in either single or double quotes. Strings in Protea are a superset of strings in JavaScript.

```dart
val string1 = "A string primitive";
val string2 = 'Also a string primitive';
val regex1 = `This is a regex literal`;

```

String literals can have one or more of four unique prefixes immediately before the opening quote, in any order and combination:

- `r` which marks a string literal as verbatim (i.e. disables escapes)
- `s` which enables interpolation
- `f` which enables formatting
- `p` which enables parameter placeholders to be embedded inside a string

The `f` flag requires either `s` or `p` flags to be enabled.

The verbatim form is enclosed in single quotes, while the interpreted form is enclosed in double quotes. Double quoted string literals allow for interpolation and formatting, in addition to escapes.

String literals can also be delimited by at least three single or double quotes, provided they end with _at least_ that many quotes of the same type. The rules for single- and double-quoted strings also apply.

Some transformations are applied to string literals of this type:

- all beginning and ending newlines and whitespace are discarded
- newlines are normalized to `\n` and carriage returns discarded
- all beginning indentation is based on the column of the opening quote, discarding whitespace as needed.

```dart
val greeting =
assert '"
Hello World
"' == greeting
```

### Escapes

Escape sequences are used to represent characters that would otherwise have a syntax error. Like a lot of languages, all escapes begin with a backslash. The first character of an escape sequence is the escape character, and the second character is the character to be escaped.

Certain single-letter escapes represent non-printable, control characters:

```
\a    U+0007  alert or bell
\b    U+0008  backspace
\e    U+000B  escape
\f    U+000C  form feed
\n    U+000A  line feed or newline
\p            platform-dependent newline
\r    U+000D  carriage return
\s    U+0020  space
\t    U+0009  horizontal tab
\v    U+000B  vertical tab
\c[A-Za-z]    control character
```

A backslash-newline joins the next line to the current line, skipping any indentation.

The escapes `\b`, `\d`, `\o`, `\u` and `\x`, allow you to encode Unicode code points as integers in a double-quoted string. The value of the literal is the value represented by the digits in the corresponding base. Any escape that also exceeds the upper limit of 0x10FFFF (decimal 1114111) will give a compile time error.

```
\b[01]+         binary
\d[0-9]+        decimal
\o[0-7]+        octal
\u[0-9A-Fa-f]+  hexadecimal (UTF-16)
\x[0-9A-Fa-f]+  hexadecimal (UTF-8)
\N($id&*[:.])   unicode name where $id is an identifier
```

Code points in the ranges `80-FF` for `\x` and `D800-DFFF` for `\u` which are used to represent multi-byte characters or surrogate pairs respectively; they hence would be invalid if they appear on their own or form an invalid byte/character sequence.

```dart
"æ¥æ¬èª"
'æ¥æ¬èª'
"\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e"
"\u0065e5\u0672c\u8a9e"
"\x{E6,97,A5 E6,9C,AC E8,AA,9E}"
```

The same escape characters when followed immediately by curly brackets are used to encode code points or byte sequences without reusing and repeating the same syntax again. You can use commas, semicolons or spaces to separate the numbers, and each running sequence is checked for validity.

```dart
decimal = "\112569"
hex = "\xABC12"
octal = "\o52740"
binary = "\b10101011110000010010"

// "HELLO"
"\x48\x45\x4c\x4c\x4f" == "\x{48 45 4c 4c 4f}"
"\d{72 69 76 76 79 65535}" == "\72\69\76\76\79"
```

The escape `\N` is used to represent a Unicode character sequences using a special notation reminiscent of LaTeX notation. The first argument can either be a name or its script, followed by the `:letter_name` or `.letter_form`.

For instance `\NA` would equal capital A, and `\NAlpha` would equal the Greek capital letter `Î` (alpha).

Use the same format within curly brackets to return multiple Unicode characters, and pass on multiple characters and spread their properties.

```dart
// => "\u{1F60A}"
"\u{1F600}" // => "ð"
"\Nemoji:smile" // => ð
"\Nflag:SG" // => ð¸ð¬
"\Nkr{an nyeong ha se yo}" // ìëíì¸ì
```

All other escapes are interpreted as the character itself, and would evaluate to the same value, just without the backslash.

### Interpolation

All forms of string literals allow expressions and variables to be interpolated into strings; simply put, the expression is evaluated and its result is substituted into the string.

The most general form of interpolation encloses an expression in between `${` and `}`, i.e. `${expression}`. The expression enclosed in the braces that follow the leading `$` is a block statement.

Escaping rules apply, so either `$` or `{` can be escaped in a backslash, and `$` is doubled.

The simpler form consists of a `$`-sign without having to write curly braces around the expression. A subset of these expressions are supported, as shown below. Between the brackets, expressions and block statements are allowed.

- a single identifier: `name`
- a qualified name: `x.y.z` or `x::y::z`
- an object accessor: `x[1]`
- a function call: `fn()`
- a type casting operation: `<int>`
- a type assertion: `name{int}`
- and any combination of the like

```dart
val greeting = "Hello $name!"
val greeting = "Hello $name.upper(){str}!"
val greeting = "Hello ${name.upper()}!"
```

The expanded expression is type-checked as with all other expressions, and can be explicitly specified using either postfix curly or angle brackets. If the types are compatible, the expression is evaluated and the result is converted to the type of the placeholder. If the types are not compatible, a type error is raised.

### Formatting

Formatting transforms the string value of the interpolated expression into a string. Formatting is done by specifying a value, and a set of arguments. The format string is a sequence of characters that specifies how the interpolated expression is to be formatted. The format arguments are the methods to be performed, in order, on the interpolated expression before it is "inserted" into the string.

```dart
"Hello ${"world"}"
"Hello ${"world"}%upper" // => "Hello WORLD"
"${1234567890}%sep:(',')|sep:(id + 1)" // => "1,234,567,890"
"Percentage correct answers: ${2 / 3}%dp:2|unit:('%')"
```

### Symbols

Symbols represent names and strings available throughout a program's execution. They are generated using the `:name` or `:"string"` literal syntax. beginning with a colon, or by various methods that return symbols.

Symbols are unique identifiers that can be used to refer to the same string or name in different contexts. Thus if `Fred` is a constant in one context, a method in another, and a class in a third, the symbol `:Fred` will be the same object in all three contexts.

Protea's symbol API uses the JavaScript Symbol API as the backend. This means that symbols are not unique across contexts, and that they can be used as keys in maps. Interpolation, formatting and template strings can use symbols as placeholders, but not the other way around.

```dart
$symbolLit = `':' (?/
  $identifier | $singleMultiQuote | $singleQuote | $doubleMultiQuote | $doubleQuote
)`

$doubleMultiQuote = ` (?<open> '"'{3,}) ( $escape | .* )+ \k<open> (?! '"') `
$doubleQuote = ` '"' ( $escape | .* )+ '"' (?! "'"+) `
$singleMultiQuote = ` (?<open> "'"{3,}) ( .* )+ \k<open> (?! "'") `
$singleQuote = ` "'" ( "''" | .* )+ "'" (?! "'"+)`
```

### Regular Expressions

Protea's regular expressions are delimited using backticks ` `` ` rather than single or double quotes as with strings. The syntax resembles JavaScript's, but with many extensions inspired by other regex flavors, including Python, Ruby and Perl.

Spacing is always ignored and comments can be inserted however you see fit. You can even 'quote' inside regular expressions by inserting strings literally inside the regex, and all spacing will be kept as is between the quotes. Interpolation and formatting also applies but the interpolated result is usually 'quoted' so to prevent generating invalid regular expressions.

```dart
$regexLit = `(
  $stringLit |
  $escape |
  $group |
  $charClass
  $interpolation |
  $formatting |
  $placeholder
)`
```

# 3nity

> The programming language for the future.

![banner](./banner.png)

**3nity** (pronounced as "Trinity") is an open source, fully featured and agile language that enables developers to build, deploy and test software on desktop, mobile, web or servers. Its static types, program verification and useful errors make it easy to catch and fix bugs, and its comprehensive APIs and portable runtime make it easy to integrate with vast ecosystems of software and libraries.

```dart
import Math.[Point, Random]

// Main function
async proc main {
  print("Compute œÄ using the Monte Carlo algorithm")
  await for val estimate in computePi().take(100):
    print("œÄ ~= $estimate")
}

// Iterator functions (function* in JavaScript)
async iter computePi(&batch: 1^5): Stream[Float] {
  var total = 0, count = 0
  loop {
    val points = generateRandom().take(batch)
    val inside = from val p in points
                 where p.isInsideCirc()
    total += batch
    count += inside.len
    val ratio = count / total
    yield ratio * 4
  }
}

sync iter generateRandom(*seed: []Int): Point {
  val random = Random(seed)
  loop:
    yield Point(random.nextFloat(), random.nextFloat())
}
```

## Overview

3nity is a language designed for writing multi-platform applications and software, using techniques applied from web development. Similar to Dart/Flutter, it is a compiler and framework combined to provide a great developer experience, while allowing to write safe, readable and maintainable code.

3nity was born out of the frustration of the JavaScript language, making it easy to write error-prone code. It also does not have the tools to create web apps out of the box, and you would need frameworks, compilers, and build tools that increase complexity.

3nity is a programming language designed with web, mobile, desktop and systems in mind.

3nity takes on its influences from [Go][go], [Kotlin][kotlin], [Rust][rust], [Scala][scala], [ReScript][rescript]/[ReasonML][reasonml], [TypeScript][typescript], [C#][csharp], [Flix][flix] and [Gosu][gosu]. With these influences, 3nity advocates for writing readable and expressive code, and enabling you to do in 3nity what you could in other languages.

## Table of Contents

This document provides everything you need to know about 3nity, from the syntax, operations and features of the language, to its core libraries and modules. This is not meant to be a tutorial or reference, but rather an aid for existing developers coming from other languages who want to learn more about how the language works and have questions to ask.

This reference is a work in progress and will be improved over time. See the GitHub repository at https://github.com/NoxVentura/3nityLang. Contributions and corrections are welcome.

A lot of my work on 3nity is still experimental and ongoing, so I am sharing this repository so I could get all of my ideas together and perhaps invite some of you to contribute your own. Once I get done with it, we can begin work on the compiler.

### A little disclaimer

3nity is a language in which programs are not text. That is, the source of truth for a program is not its textual representation as source code, but its structured representation as an abstract syntax tree (AST).

This document describes 3nity in terms of its default (and currently, only) textual rendering into source code.

3nity only encodes text in UTF-8; other encodings are not supported. Any of the standard line termination sequences can be used, depending on the platform: `\r`, `\n` or `\r\n`.

3nity has only three file types: module (`*.3n`), script (`*.3s`), config (`*.3c`) and markup (`*.3m`).

Module files are the most commonly used as they can be imported and exported through packages. The entry point of a 3nity module is defined in the `main` function.

```dart
/// @file main.3n
func main(*args: []Str): Void { /*...*/ }
```

The type annotations or the spread `*args` declaration can be left out, so it can be `fun main {}` instead.

Script files do not have a `main` function, but they can import other modules and files.

3nity markup is a special branch of 3nity whose syntax is derived from JSX, HTML and Stylus which enable you to build UIs, style them and add functionality. HTML snippets can be interlaced in 3nity module files and passed on as objects.

```dart
elem MyElem as my-elem {
  field foo = 'foo'
  field whales: Int = 5

  async def onClick(e) {
    whales += 1;
    await updateComplete()
    new Event(
      :whales
      {detail: {whales: this.whales}}
    ).dispatch()
  }

  style :host { display: block }
  style :host(:hidden) { display: none }

  stat def render = [
    <h4>Foo: ${this.foo}</h4>
    <div>whales: ${\üÖ±Ô∏è * whales}</div>
    <slot></slot>
  ]
}
```

## Syntax

### Some Guidelines

#### Syntax

3nity is a curly-brace language similar to JavaScript, Rust, Scala and Kotlin, which means that code blocks and closures are delimited using curly brackets.

Semicolons are completely optional though they can be used to terminate multiple statements on the same line. This makes it easier to

#### Comments

Comments start anywhere outside a "string" literal with two slashes, and runs until the end of the line. If the next line only of a comment piece with no other tokens between it and the preceding one, it does not start a new comment.

```dart
const x = 10 // This is a single comment over multiple lines.
// The scanner merges these two pieces.
// The comment continues here.
```

Documentation comments are comments that start with three slashes `///` rather than two. Documentation comments are tokens; they are only allowed at certain places in the input file as they belong to the syntax tree!

```dart
1 /// This is a documentation comment
```

3nity supports two types of multi-line comments beginning with `/*` and ending in `*/`.

```dart
/*  Comment here.
    Multiple lines
    are not a problem. */
```

`/+ +/` allow nesting.

```dart
/+
/+ Multiline comment in already commented out code. +/
+/
```

Multiline documentation comments also exist and support nesting too. They begin with two asterisks or plus signs (`/**` `/++`) instead of one, and end in only one of each type.

```dart
/** this is a multi-line documentation comment */
/++ and this is its nested cousin +/
```

### Top-level declarations

A top-level declaration can appear at the top level or outermost scope of a Unison file. It can be one of the following forms:

- A declaration, like `val x = 42`, or `type Option[a] = None | Some[a]`.
- An `import`, `export` or `using` clause.

A variable binding begins with `var`, `val`, `let`, or `const`. `var` and `let` declare an mutable variable binding, whereas `val` and `const` declare a mutable variable binding. All bindings are [block-scoped](https://medium.com/@allansendagi/block-scope-in-javascript-8fd2f909e848).

A variable binding looks like this:

```dart
var x = 42
val x: Int = 42
```

`let` and `const` bindings can be redeclared, even on the same scoped.

```dart
var x = 42
val x: Int = 42
```

Multiple variables can be assigned, similar to Python:

```dart
val x, y = 0, 0
```

Or unpacked from an iterable, list (array), set or map:

```dart
(x, y): (Int, Int) = (42, 42)
[x, y]: [Int, Int] = [42, 42]
{x, y}: {[Str]: Int} = {x: 42, y: 42}
{x, y}: {}Int = {42, 10}
```

### Keywords

The following are all the keywords of the language. Keywords are grouped into five different sections:

- expression keywords, which are keywords used as operators
- declaration keywords, which declare program entities such as variables, classes and functions,
- modifier keywords which modify such declarations,
- general keywords which command and control program flow and execution.
- pre-defined, or dynamic constants and variables.

As for modifier keywords, they are parsed as keywords before a declaration as they modify them. `pub var x = 1` declares a public variable.

    import export using
    debug assert where

    true false null void nan infin

    params ctor proto pro

### Identifiers

3nity defines Unicode letters, combining diacritical or punctuation marks, and decimal digits as identifier characters. A sequence of those would form an identifier, provided they do not start with a combining diacritical mark or a decimal digit.

Tags and attributes used for JSX tags can include dashes, but must not end with any amount of trailing dashes.

#### Naming conventions

Naming conventions follow Java or JavaScript. There are four types of identifiers which 3nity recognizes and highlights accordingly:

- `SHOUT_CASE`, used for constants,
- `PascalCase` used for classes, modules, namespaces, and types.
- `camelCase` or `snake_case` used for variables, parameters, functions and methods.
- `_leading` underscores for special methods and keywords.

#### Identifier Comparison

Variables are compared using their first character, then comparing further characters case-insensitively and ignoring all delimiters. This makes it easier for developers to use varying conventions without having to worry about the variables' exact spelling.

```dart
proc cmpIdent(a: Str, b: Str): Bool =
  a[0] == b[0] &&
  a.sub(`[^\pL\d]+`g, "").lower() == b.sub(`[^\pL\d]+`g, "").lower()
```

All keywords are written with all lowercase characters. To strop keywords, add one or more trailing underscores. Keywords also lose their meaing when they are part of a qualified name, not including its source (the leading parts of oa).

```dart
type Type = {
  def: Func,
}

val object_ = new Type({def: |x| x = 10})
assert object_ is Type
assert object_.def == 9

var var_ = 42
val val_ = 8
assert var_ + let_ == 50

val assert_ = true
assert assert_
```

### Booleans, Null and Void

`Null` and `void` are one and the same.

```dart
null; void
assert null == void
assert null == void
```

A boolean data type can only have two values: `true` or `false`. Booleans are mainly used for control flow, and there are a lot of operators that return boolean values.

```dart
true; false
```

All values default to an empty value, which means they yield `false` when converted into booleans. All other values, including non-primitive objects, yield true.

Boolean values also come as a result of comparisons, or other logical operations.

```dart
val isGreater = 4 > 1 // true
```

### Numbers

3nity supports integers and floating-point numbers. Floats compile to regular JavaScript `number`s, [IEEE-754 double-precision floating-point][double] while integers compile to `bigint` (arbitrary-precision integers). Floats are typically distinguished between integers with a dot.

[double]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format

```dart
val integer: Int = 123
val floating: Float = 12.345
```

[double]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format

Numbers are case-insensitive including its type suffix, and can contain leading zeroes and underscores for readability. Integer and floating-point literals can be written in base 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 or 16:

| Base | Name        | Prefix    | Digits                       |
| ---- | ----------- | --------- | ---------------------------- |
| 2    | Binary      | `0b`      | `0` and `1`                  |
| 4    | Quaternary  | `0q`      | `0` to `3`                   |
| 6    | Senary      | `0s`      | `0` to `5`                   |
| 8    | Octal       | `0o`      | `0` to `7`                   |
| 10   | Decimal     | no prefix | `0` to `9`                   |
| 12   | Duodecimal  | `0z`      | `0` to `9`, then `a` and `b` |
| 16   | Hexadecimal | `0x`      | `0` to `9` then `a` to `f`   |

```dart
val base2 = 0b101010111100000100100011
val base4 = 0q320210213202
val base6 = 0s125423
val base8 = 0o52740443
val base10 = 0011256099
val base12 = 0z10a37b547ab97
val base16 = 0xabcdef123
```

Floating-point numbers can allow different kinds of delimiters and separators,

Repeating fractional blocks are separated with a tilde `~`, so `0.3~33` or simply `0.~3` is equal to `0.33333333333333...`. Fractional literals separate their numerator and denominator with a slash `/`.

```dart
0.3~33 == 0.~3 == 1/3
```

Exponents are relative to the base, but are written in base 10. Therefore `1 * 16^10` is equal to `0x1^10`. If you want a custom base, use the notation `coefficient*base^power`, where the power is signed.

```dart
1 * 16^10 == 0x1^10
```

Precision is delimited using `=n` where `n` is the number of places after the "decimal" point. `!` counts significant figures rather than mantisa digits, while `-` or `+` toggles whether to always round up or down as opposed to automatically.

```dart
10=10
```

The last component of a numeric literal is called a _type suffix_. The colon denoting the type suffix cannot be left out.

By extending from the class `Numeric.Format`, arbitrary base values can be used. By default, all digits are decimal, though any alphanumeric character can be used.

Arbitrary bases can be used, beginning with `nb` where `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. The digits are usually decimal, though any alphanumeric can be used when suffixed with a type.

```dart
class Base17 < Numeric.Format {
  swap field digits: Str | []Char = '0123456789abcdefg'
  swap field under: Bool = false
}

const number = 17b1894398:Base17
assert number == 17b1_89__43_98:Base17 == 36268794
```

### Strings

Strings function the same way as in JavaScript, and are delimited by matching quotes. Only double-quoted strings contain escape sequences which all begin with a backslash. Single-quoted strings are raw, which means that escape sequences are not transformed.

```dart
var s1 = 'Single quotes work well for string literals.'
var s2 = "Double quotes work just as well."
```

Single-quoted raw strings the escape sequences for double-quoted strings mentioned above are not escaped. To escape a single quote, double it.

```dart
var daughterOfTheVoid = 'Kai''Sa'
```

Double quoted string literals can contain the following escape sequences, and can contain the following escape sequences:

| Escape Sequence | Meaning                                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `\p`            | platform specific newline (`\r\n`, `\n`, `\r`) |
| `\r`            | carriage return (`\x9`)                        |
| `\n`            | line feed (or newline) (`\xA`)                 |
| `\f`            | form feed (`\xC`)                              |
| `\t`            | horizontal tabulator (`\x9`)                   |
| `\v`            | vertical tabulator (`\xB`)                     |
| `\a`            | alert (`\x7`)                                  |
| `\b`            | backspace (`\x8`)                              |
| `\e`            | escape (`\xB`)                                 |
| `\s`            | space (`\x20`)                                 |

3nity also supports escapes in even bases up to 16, excluding 14.

| Escape Sequence      | Meaning                                        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `\b` (beside 0 or 1) | _Base 2_ - from `0` to `100001111111111111111` |
| `\q`                 | _Base 4_ - from `0` to `10033333333`           |
| `\s` (beside 0 to 5) | _Base 6_ - from `0` to `35513531`              |
| `\o`                 | _Base 8_ - from `0` to `4177777`               |
| `\d` or `\`          | _Base 10_ - from `0` to `1114111`              |
| `\z`                 | _Base 12_ - from `0` to `4588A7`               |
| `\x`                 | _Base 16_ - from `0` to `10FFFF`               |
| `\u`                 | UTF-8, 16 or 32 code units only                |
| `\j`                 | Named Unicode characters and LaTeX expressions |

The same escapes with curly brackets allow you to insert many code points inside, with each character or code unit separated by spaces. Only `\j` requires curly brackets.

```dart
// "HELLO"
"\x48\x45\x4c\x4c\x4f" == "\x{48 45 4c 4c 4f}"
"\d{72 69 76 76 69}" == "\72\69\76\76\79"
```

In single quoted strings, to escape single quotes, double them.

```dart
var s3 = 'It''s easy to escape the string delimiter.'
var s4 = "It's even easier to use the other delimiter."
```

In double-quoted strings, an ending backslash joins the next line _without spaces_.

```dart
assert "hello \
        world" == "hello world"
```

#### Block strings

String literals can also be delimited by at least three single or double quotes, provided they end with _at least_ that many quotes of the same type.

The rules for single- and double-quoted strings also apply.

```dart
'''
  "stringified string"
'''
""" "stringified string""""
```

produces:

    "stringified string"

All newlines and whitespace before the first non-line character and after the last non-line character are discarded.

All indentation is determined based on the first line of text (the first non-whitespace character). All indentation after that column is preserved while those before it are discarded.

Newlines are normalized to `\n`.

```dart
'''
"stringified
  string"
''' ==
"""
  "stringified
    string"
"""
```

Any string that does not obey this rule is a compile-time error.

```dart
"""
  "stringified
string"
"""
```

#### Backslash strings

Strings can also be delimited using an initial backslash. Strings cannot contain any sequence of `\s`, `\n` `,`, `;`, `'`, `"`, `` ` ``, `<`, `>`, `$`, `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, `/>`, `::`, `!:`, `?:`, `.`, `!.`, and `?.`.

```dart
\word
func(\word, \word)
func\word
[\word]
{prop: \word}
```

Backslash block strings also begin with a backslash followed by either `|` or `>`, both functioning like block strings. `\|` behaves like the single quote and `\>` the double quote.

Block strings also begin with a backslash followed by either `|` or `>`, both functioning like `|` block strings. `\|` behaves like the single quote and `\>` the double quote.

Like YAML, backslash block strings can also be appended with a "chomping indicator" `+` or `-` to preserve or remove the line feed, or fold the line past how many spaces.

```dart
\|
  this is my very very "very" long-ass string.
  Love, 3nity.
\>
  this is my very very "very" long-\
  ass string.\nLove, 3nity.
```

3nity comes with several avenues to make manipulating, formatting and serializing strings easier.

#### String Interpolation

All forms of string literals, with exception to inline backslash strings, can enable embedding of arbitrary expressions. Embedded expressions are prefixed with the dollar and surrounded by curly brackets.

If the expression is an identifier or qualified name, then the brackets can be left out. Use the `\$` escape sequence if you wish to express the dollar sign itself.

```dart
"x is $x, in hex $x.toHex, and x+8 is ${x + 8}"
```

is syntax sugar for:

```dart
"x is " + x + ", in hex " + x.toHex + ", and x+8 is " + (x + 8)
```

The hash sign takes several arguments, as placeholders, passed to the `format` method. Arguments can either be named, numbered or keyed.

```dart
'#0%s is #1 meters tall'.format('James', 1.9)
// "James is 1.9 meters tall"
```

#### Format Directives

3nity provides an extensive string formatting mini-language for converting, transforming, transl(iter)ating and serialising strings. Its syntax derives from Command Prompt.

They are composed of the following parts:

- A command: `%command` denoted by a percentage sign
- An optional range of switches, each denoted by a slash `/switch`,
- Their optional values, separated by a colon: `/sw:value`.

```dart
const prices = { bread: 4.50 }
'I like bread. It costs $prices.bread%f/cur:SGD.'
// "I like bread. It costs $4.50."
```

#### Macro Strings

Macro strings are used to embed domain-specific languages directly into 3nity, and are functionally the same as tagged template literals. The construct `name"string"` or `name("string")`, denotes a macro call with a string as its own argument.

A macro function is defined with the keyword `macro` rather than `fun`. The first argument of a `macro` contains a list of intermediate strings, the second being the interpolated values or placeholders, and the third being the formatting metadata.

```dart
macro template(strings, keys) = |*values| {
  val dict = values[-1] ?? {}
  val values = from val key in keys
    select if key is Int: values[key]
    else: dict[key]
  values = values as List
  return strings.intercalate(keys).join('')
}

val t1Closure = template"${0}${1}${0}!"
assert t1Closure("Y", "A") == "YAY!"
val t2Closure = template"${0} ${"foo"}!"
assert t2Closure("Hello", {foo: "World"}) == "Hello World!"
```

### Regular expressions

Regular expressions function like strings, except delimited using backticks `` ` `` as opposed to quotes. Regular expressions allow free spacing and embedded comments. Escaping rules apply though between `()` and `[]` the backtick itself need not be escaped.

Escaping rules apply, though in between brackets the backtick need not be escaped. Interpolation and formatting also applies but the interpolated result is usually escaped so to prevent generating invalid regular expressions.

3nity uses the [Oniguruma](https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma) regular expression flavor by default, the same regex engine that powers Ruby and PHP7. But it adds its own extensions and will be (re)implemented in 3nity.

```dart
`\b{wb}(fee|fie|foe|fum)\b{wb}`x
`[ ! @ " $ % ^ & * () = ? <> ' : {} \[ \] `]`x
`
  \/\* // Match the opening delimiter.
  .*?  // Match a minimal number of characters.
  \*\/ // Match the closing delimiter.
`
```

Multi-quoted and block regular expressions are also supported.

````dart
```(?/
  <<= | >>= | #= | \*\*=
  | \+= | -= | /= | \@=
  | \*= | %= | ~= | \^= | \&= | \|=
  | =(?!=) \p{is Latin}
)```

\< x
  (?:[a-zA-Z_]|(?:\\u[0-9a-fA-F]{4}|\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}))(?:[a-zA-Z0-9_]|(?:\\u[0-9a-fA-F]{4}|\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}))*(?=:)
````

If there are two adjacent regular expression literals on one side, then the one on the right is the substitution (template) string for the regular expression on the left.

```dart
val str = 'James Bond'
val newStr = str =< `(\w+)\W+(\w+)` `$2, $1` // 'Bond, James'
val newStr = str =< `(\w+)\W+(\w+)` `My name is $2, $0!`
// 'My name is Bond, James Bond'
```

The following section serves as a summary to the regular expression syntax of 3nity, as well as some of the more unique features that Nova has over other regex flavors.

#### Basic Syntax Elements

| Syntax      | Description                                     |

#### Replacement String

This syntax applies to the second regex literal onward in regex operations such as substitution and transliteration. If any group referenced in the index before is invalid group, it is inserted literally.

| Syntax    | Meaning                                                                        |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| `$0`      | Inserts the entire matched substring into the output.                          |
| `$-`      | Inserts the portion of the string that precedes the matched substring.         |
| `$+`      | Inserts the portion of the string that follows the matched substring.          |
| `$n`      | Where `n` is a positive integer, inserts the `n`th submatch.                   |
| `$<name>` | Where name is a capturing group name, inserts the submatch assigned to `name`. |

## Collections

3nity comes with four different collection literals: lists `[]`, sets `{}`, maps `{:}`. All collection literals are immutable. A `Mut` prefix on its type or a hash `#` right before the literal makes them mutable, and allows you to mutate them directly.

### Lists

Lists are indexed collections of values, are surrounded by square brackets and each element is separated by commas.

The type signature of a list is `List[Value]` or `{}Value`.

```dart
var x: []Int = [10, 20, 30]
var y = [\a, \b, \c] // is []Str
```

The type of the list uses the postfix curly bracket notation, where you can explicitly specify the type of the list.

```dart
var z = [10, '20', '30']{Str|Int} // with type casting operator
```

If the type is omitted, then type inference is used to determine the type of the items. The type of the items is determined by taking the union type of all the elements of the list. For example:

```dart
assert [1, 2, 3] is []Nat &&
  [1, null, 3] is []?Nat &&
  [1., 2., 3.] is []Float &&
  [1, -2, 3] is []Int &&
  [1, "2", 3] is [](Nat|Str) &&
  [1, 2, 3]{Num} is []Num &&
  [[10, 20], [30]] is [][]Int
```

Often the compiler will infer a list to have a non-nullable type. If the list might store `null` or `void` values, then you will need to explicitly cast it.

```dart
[1, 2, 3] // cannot store null
[1, 2, 3, null]{?Nat} // can store null
```

The empty list is denoted using the special syntax `[]`. Often you will specify a type - for example `[]{Str}` is an empty list of strings. If a type is not specified, then the empty list evaluates to a `[]{Any}`.

### Sets

Sets are ordered collections of unique, distinct elements, and are surrounded by curly brackets, with each element is separated by commas.

The type signature of a set is `Set[Key]` or `{}Key`.

```dart
var x: {}Int = {10, 20, 30}
var y = {\a, \b, \c} // is []Str
var z = {10, '20', '30']{Str|Int}
```

If the type is omitted, then type inference is used to determine the type of the items. The type of the items is determined by taking the union type of all the elements of the list. For example:

```dart
assert {1, '2', 3, :4} is {}(Int|Str|Sym)
```

The empty set is denoted using the special syntax `{}`. If the type is not specified, the set is automatically `{}{Any}`.

### Maps

Maps are keyed collections of unique elements, surrounded by curly brackets like sets. Each key is unique and is assigned to a non-distinct value, separated by a colon. Pairs are separated by commas, just like lists and sets.

```dart
var x: {Int : Str} = {1: 'one', 2: 'two'}
var y = {3: 'three', 4: 'four'} // is []Str
var z = {10, '20', '30'}{Str : Int}
```

The type signature of a map is `Map[Key, Value]` or `{Key : Value}`. Note the colon is spaced out on both sides. `{Key: Value}` is a map with the string value `Key` which can hold the type `Value`.

The type of keys are determined as follows:

- If a key is a constant, i.e. `true`, `false`, `null`, `void`, `infin` or `nan`, it will be parsed as its value.
- If a key can be parsed as a number it is a number.
- If a key begins with `:`, `'`, `"`, `:'`, `:"`, `` ` ``, `[`, `(`, `{`, `#[`, `#(`, `#{`, it would not be treated as an unquoted string.
- ANy other ihtirh

The empty map is denoted using the special syntax `{:}` so not to be confused with the empty set syntax. If there is no explicit type, it is inferred to be `{Any : Any}`.

Note that maps may not be typed with a nullable key. If you are using type inference, you might need to explicitly type a map which will store null:

```dart
{1: 'one', 2: 'two'} // cannot store null
{1: 'one', 2: 'two'}{Int : ?Str} // now it can
```

### Symbols

A symbol represents a unique name inside the entire source code. Symbols are interpreted at compile time and cannot be created dynamically.

The only way to create a symbol is by using a symbol literal, denoted by a colon (`:`) followed by an unquoted string beginning with a word character, and follows the same rules as an unquoted string.

The identifier may optionally be enclosed in single or double quotes.

```dart
:unquoted_symbol
:"quoted symbol"
:"a" // identical to :a
:„ÅÇ
```

A quoted identifier can contain any Unicode character including white-spaces and can same escape sequences as a string literal, including interpolation. Use interpolation to create dynamic keys.

```dart
:question?
:exclamation!
```

## Expressions

3nity's expression syntax is very similar to C, PHP, Java, Elixir, Haskell and others. 3nity has built-in operators:

### Custom Operators

In 3nity, operators are methods. Any method with a single parameter can be used as an infix operator. For example, `+` can be called with dot-notation:

```dart
10.+(1)
```

However, it's easier to read as an infix operator:

```dart
10 + 1
```

Infix operators are spaced out on both sides. This makes it clear it is an infix operator and not any other.

#### Defining and using operators

You can use any legal identifier as an operator. This includes a name like `add` or a symbol(s) like `+`.

```dart
ext Vec(x: Float, y: Float) {
  def + (this, that: Vec) = new Vec(this.x + that.x, this.y + that.y)
}

val vec1 = new Vec(1.0, 1.0)
val vec2 = new Vec(2.0, 2.0)

val vec3 = vec1 + vec2
vec3.x // 3.0
vec3.y // 3.0
```

The class `Vec` has a method `+` which we used to add `vec1` and `vec2`. Using parentheses, you can build up complex expressions with readable syntax. Here is the definition of class MyBool which includes methods and and or:

```dart
ext MyBool(x: Bool) {
  def && (): MyBool = if x: that else: this
  def || (): MyBool = if x: this else: that
  def !(): MyBool = new MyBool(!x)
}
```

It is now possible to use `and` and `or` as infix operators:

```dart
// def declares a method even outside classes
def !(x: MyBool) = !x
def ^^ (x: MyBool, y: MyBool) = x || y && !(x && y)
```

This helps to make the definition of `xor` more readable.

### Associativity

Binary operators whose first character is `@` are right-associative, all other binary operators are left-associative.

```dart
def @/ (x, y: Float): Float = result = x / y
// a right-associative division operator
print(12 @/ 4 @/ 8) // 24.0 (4 / 8 = 0.5, then 12 / 0.5 = 24.0)
print(12  / 4  / 8) // 0.375 (12 / 4 = 3.0, then 3 / 8 = 0.375)
```

A spaced out `?`, `!` and `$` is a ternary expression and has the lowest precedence. The rightmost part is separated with a colon `:`. `$` is the same as infix method calls on identifiers.

```dart
x.xor(a) == x $ xor : a
```

#### Precedence

If the operator ends with `=` and its first character is none of `<`, `>`, `!`, `=`, it is an assignment operator which has the second-lowest precedence.

```dart
def + (x: Num, y: Num): Num = x + y
def - (x: Num, y: Num): Num = x - y
val a = 1
a += 1; a == 2
a -= 1; a == 1
```

If the operator begins with `<`, `>`, `!` or `=` then it is a relational operator and they can be chained.

```dart
import Sys.Comparable

def <=> (x: Comparable, y: Comparable): Bool = x.cmp(y)
def < (x, y): Bool = x <=> y in [-1]
def <= (x, y): Bool = x <=> y in [-1, 0]
def > (x, y): Bool = x <=> y in [1]
def >= (x, y): Bool = x <=> y in [0, 1]
def == (x, y): Bool = x <=> y in [0]
def <> (x, y): Bool = x <=> y in [-1, 1]

assert (1 <> 2 <> 3) == (1 <> 2 && 2 <> 3)
```

When an expression uses multiple operators, the operators are evaluated based on the priority of the first character:

```txt
(characters not shown below)
* / % #
+ -
: ~
= ! < >
&
^
|
?
arrow operators
$
assignment operators
ternary operators ? :, ! :, and $ :
```

This applies to functions you define. For example, the following expression:

```dart
a + b ^? c ?^ d $ less : a ==> b | c
```

Is equivalent to

```dart
((a + b) ^? (c ?^ d)) $ less : ((a ==> b) | c)
```

`?^` has the highest precedence because it starts with the character `?`. `+` has the second highest precedence, followed by `==>,` `^?`, `|`, and less.

Operators ending in either `->`, `~>` or `=>`, or starting with `<-`, `<~` or `<=` are called arrow-like, and have a higher precedence than ternary operators.

```dart
((a + b) ^? (c ?^ d)) $ less : ((a ==> b) | c)
```

#### Binary Operators

Binary operators include interfix and infix operators. Interfix operators are evaluated first, from left to right.

```dart
def?.(a: Any, b: Any): Any = ?a ? void : a[b]
val a = {1: {c: \d}}
assert a?.b?.c == void
assert a?.1?.c == \d
```

#### Suffix Operators

Suffix operators are evaluated from left to right, have a single argument and are composed of only one character. They bind strongly and are evaluated after binary operators.

```dart
def+ (a: Num): Num = a + 1
def- (a: Num): Num = a - 1
val a = 1
assert a++ == (a+)+ == 3
assert a-- == (a-)- == -1
```

#### Prefix Operators

Prefix operators function the same way as suffix operators except they are evaluated from right to left. They are evaluated after suffix operators.

```dart
def -(a: Num): Num = a.neg()
val a = 1000
assert --a == -(-a) == a
```

#### Unary Operators

A unary modifier defines both suffix and prefix operators as valid operations on its only argument.

```dart
def! !(x: Bool): Bool = !x
val x = true
assert !x! == !(x!) == true
assert x! == !x == false
```

## Control Statements

### Introduction: expression-oriented programming

As a brief note about programming in general, when every expression you write returns a value, that style is referred to as expression-oriented programming, or EOP. The examples above are all expressions.

Conversely, lines of code that don't return values are called statements, and they are used for their side-effects. For example, these lines of code don‚Äôt return values, so they are used for their side effects:

```dart
if a == b: doSomething()
print("Hello")
```

### Basic closures

Bindings can be scoped through the do-block: `do {}`.

```dart
val message = do {
  val part1 = "hello"
  val part2 = "world"
  part1 ++ " " ++ part2
}
// `part1` and `part2` not accessible here!
```

The value of the last line of a scope is implicitly returned.

`if`, `while` and functions all use the same block scoping mechanism.

```dart
if displayGreeting {
  val message = "Enjoying the docs so far?"
  print(message)
}
// `message` not accessible here!
```

Instead of a block, whenever there's a single statement, use the colon `:` instead of an opening curly brace.

```dart
val message = do: 3 + 4
```

But not both (opening curly brace is a set literal):

```dart
val message = do: { 3 + 4 }
assert message is Set
```

### Conditionals

A basic `if` statement looks like this:

```dart
if a == b: doSomething()
```

Or like this:

```dart
if a == b:
  doSomething()
```

or even like this:

```dart
if a == b {
  doSomething()
}
```

An if-else expression without the final `else` branch implicitly gives `()` (aka the unit type).

```dart
if showMenu { displayMenu() }
// is equivalent to
if showMenu { displayMenu() } else { null }
```

The if/else construct looks like this:

```dart
if a == b {
  doSomething()
} else {
  doSomethingElse()
}
```

The complete 3nity `if`/`else if`/`else` expression looks like this:

```dart
if test1 {
  doX()
} elif test2 { // not "else if"
  doY()
} else {
  doZ()
}
```

Replacing `if` with `un` and `elif` with `elun` for the opposite effect (`un` is short for `unless`).

```dart
un test1 { // unless; if not
  doX()
} elun test2 { // unless; if not
  doY()
} else {
  doZ()
}
```

A great thing about the 3nity conditional is that it always returns. You can ignore the result as we did in the previous examples, but a more common approach, especially in functional programming.

You can assign the result to a variable:

```dart
val minValue = if a < b: a else: b
```

Anyway, 3nity has two ternary conditional operators, which are just syntax sugar for the above if you're not keen on using `if`. That last one, is syntax sugar for `un`...`else`.

```dart
val minValue = a < b ? a : b
val maxValue = a > b ! a : b
```

### While Loops

While loops execute its body code block while its condition is true.

```dart
while i < 10 {
  text += "The number is $i"
  i += 1
}
```

`loop-while` is a variant of `while`. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.

```dart
loop {
  text += "The number is $i"
  i += 1
} while i < 10
```

Until loops execute their bodies until their statements become false.

```dart
until i == 10 {
  text += "The number is $i"
  i += 1
}

loop {
  text += "The number is $i"
  i += 1
} until i == 10

loop: text += "The number is $i" && i += 1 until i == 10
```

Loop block runs indefinitely.

```dart
loop:
  print("hello world forever!")

val i = 1
loop {
  print("i is now $i")
  if i > 100: break
  i *= 2
}
assert i == 128
```

#### Loop keywords

3nity has three keywords relating to loops:

- stop and exit a loop or an enumeration using the `break` keyword
- jump to the next iteration or step using the `next` keyword
- repeat the current iteration or step using the `redo` keyword

```dart
label x: loop {
  if new Random() > 0.3: break x
  elif new Random() > 0.5: next x
  elif new Random() > 0.7: redo x
  else: log("Still running")
}
```

All are system calls so they can be interlaced with expressions.

### For-loops

In its most simple use, a `for` or `each` loop can be used to iterate over the elements in a collection. For example, given a list of integers:

```dart
val numbers = [1, 2, 3]
```

you can loop over them and print out their values like this:

```dart
for val n in numbers: print(n)
```

A second variable is assigned to their indices (i.e keys):

```dart
for val number, index in numbers: print(n, x)
```

You can loop over the keys of a map (or any other keyed collection) with `of` rather than `in`.

```dart
val list = [4, 5, 6]
for val i in list:
  print(i) // "0", "1", "2",
for val i of list:
  print(i) // "4", "5", "6"
for val n of numbers: print(n)
```

### Switch or match

Pattern matching provides a way to conditionally execute code when the shape of some data matches a particular pattern. It is similar to `switch`-`case` statements in other languages, but it can be more expressive and includes some extra safeguards.

A `match` expression looks like below. You can also use `switch` rather than `match`; they are one and the same.

```dart
match expression {
  case case1: value1
  case case2: value2
  case case3: value3
  case: defaultValue
}
```

A `match` or `switch` expression is valid if:

- the condition should be any type
- branches must be of the same type as the condition
- the values of all branches must be the same type

#### Patterns

Primitive values are checked for equality.

```dart
switch (x: ?(Bool|Float)) {
  case true: 'true'
  case false: 'false'
  case null: 'null'
  case infin: 'infin'
  case nan: 'nan'
}
```

Variables can be created from patterns. In the previous examples, the `_` variable acted as a catch-all. You could instead create a variable without a leading underscore to use it later in the block.

```dart
switch f() {
  case 0: "zero"
  case 1: "one"
  case k: "another number " ++ string_of_int(k)
}
```

Note that if a variable with the same name already exists in the scope of the switch, then it will be shadowed by the variable declared in the pattern inside the code after the:. The original variable is not used in the pattern. Variables in patterns are declarations of new variables, not references to existing ones.

```dart
val k = 60;
val x = 3;

val y = switch x {
  case 0: "zero"
  case 1: "one"
  case k: "another number " ++ string_of_int(k)
}
```

Patterns can also include variants and data held by variant tags. For example, matching against an optional type:

```dart
val x: ?Int = Some(3)
val value = switch x {
  case null: 0
  case ?v: v
}
```

Patterns can include other data structures, like lists, sets, maps, and any nested combination of those structures.

```dart
type R = {x: int, y: int}
type T = A[[Str, Int]] | B[R] | C[#[]Int] | D[[]R]
val x = D([{x: 2, y: 1.2}]);

switch x : T {
  case A(['hi', num]): num
  case B({x, y: 1.2}): x
  case C(x): X
  case C(#[2, 3, x]): x
  case D([]): 2
  case D([{x: x1, _}, {x: x2, _}, *_]): x1 + x2
  case: 42
}
```

`as` can be used to assign part of a pattern to a variable. This is convenient if you need to match on a certain value, but need to reference something that encompasses that value.

```dart
switch x {
  case v as A[['hi', num]]: f(v)
  case r as B[{x: _, y: 1.2}]: g(r)
  case D([r as {x: _, y: 1.2}, *_]): g(r)
  case: 42
}
```

Pass a tuple/list if you want to match multiple inputs.

```dart
switch [k1, k2] {
  case [1, "a"]: 0
  case [_, "b"]: 1
  case: 3
}
```

A single block of code can be run for multiple patterns by listing them together. Type expressions, beginning with a spaced out `:`, can also be used to list multiple possibilities.

```dart
val items: []Int = [1, 2, 3, 4]

switch (items) {
  case [1, 2], [3, 4]: "is [1, 2] or [3, 4]"
  case [1, 2, 3, 4]: "is [1, 2, 3, 4]"
  case [5, : 6 | 7, *_]: "starts with 5, then has 6 or 7"
  case: ""
}
```

Matching on strings, regular expressions and functions allow you to extract those data from them.

```dart
val sample: Str = '10-a'
switch sample {
  case '${x: Int}-dir': exec(x)
  case `(?<x>\d+)-dir`: exec(x)
  case x if x ~= `^\d+-dir$`: exec(x)
}
```

Patterns can also be used outside of switch statements to "unpack" data whenever variables are declared.

```dart
val data_ = [1, ["red", true]];
val [a, c: [b, _]] = data_;
/* a is 1, b is "red", c is ("red", true) */

val f = |p :| x + y + p.x + p.y;
```

`if` or `un` can add extra conditions to patterns. The condition must be satisfied in order to execute the pattern's code, otherwise the pattern is skipped.

```dart
val p = {x: 2, y: 2}
val z = 3
val k = switch p {
  case ({x, y: 0}) if x == z: 0
  case ({x, y: 0}) if f(x): 1
  case ({x: 2, y}) if y < 10: 2
  case ({x: 2, y}) if y < 2: 3 /* never executed, but no warning */
  case _: 4
}
/* k is 2 */
```
